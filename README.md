## Description

For this project i was asked to create a blog. I decided to create a music blog for unknown music. 

I was tasked with creating the following pages: 

-	Home page
-	About page
-	List of blog posts
-	Blog post specific pages
-	Contact page.

The contact page has javascript validation and the blogposts all link dynamically. The blog list page has a show more button. The Album elements and the about page is gathered from wordpress and can be easily changed in wordpress to dynamically change or add content
